## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository contains small, practical projects inspired by real-world problems and spontaneous ideas.

Most projects start as simple concepts — often thought of while driving — and evolve into working prototypes to explore:

- ⚙️ DevOps workflows  
- 🐳 Containerization (Docker)  
- 🔄 CI/CD concepts  
- 🚀 Deployment strategies  
- 🛠 Automation scripts  
- 📦 Infrastructure experimentation  

The goal is simple: **Build → Deploy → Improve → Repeat.**
